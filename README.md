# Advanced Learning Algorithms
Code learned and demonstrated by Andrew Ng provided through the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. The follow-up
to the Supervised and Unsuperivsed learning course, Advanced Learning Algorithms dives in to meshing machine learning
algorithms together through the implementation of neural networks. These advanced models allow us to approach more difficult
problems on large data sets.
